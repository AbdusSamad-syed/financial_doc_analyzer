# Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Assignment

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.
Mission & Bugs Fixed

**The project had two main issues:**
Deterministic Bugs:

1.Missing or incorrect imports in tools.py and agents.py.
2.Async PDF reading function corrected (read_data_tool).
3.File upload issues fixed in FastAPI endpoint (analyze_financial_document).
4.Proper handling of empty queries and cleanup of temporary files.
5.Ensured all CrewAI agents had valid LLM references and tools.

Inefficient Prompts:

1)Optimized task descriptions for clarity and useful outputs.
2)Investment and risk analysis prompts refined for realistic insights.
3)Document verification logic simplified and made consistent.

Outcome: The codebase is now fully functional and produces coherent financial analysis results.
